# About Me
Hello! My name is Shrey, a high school junior, and am a Machine Learning Engineer, specializing in Computer Vision and Deep Learning Research. I love to program when I can, and I program things such as Deep Learning Models, Custom Diffusion Models, and Neural Networks from Scratch! 

# What I like
- I use HuggingFace for pre-trained models. Check it out at huggingface.co
- I use pytorch mainly, but also know some tensorflow
- Currently working on a research project with 3D NeRFs
