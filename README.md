# About Me
Hello! My name is Shrey, a high school sophomore, who is a Data Engineer, specializing in Computer Vision and Deep Learning Research. I love to program when I can, and I program things such as Deep Learning Models, Custom Object Detection Models, and Neural Networks from Scratch! 

# What I like
- I use Roboflow. Check it out at roboflow.ai
- I mainly use TensorFlow, but have just started learning PyTorch
- Neural Networks from scratch. Check out this great book at nnfs.io

That's all. I'm learning web dev, so stay on the lookout for a website!
